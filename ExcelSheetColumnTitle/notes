consider the letter 'A' to have a value of 1, 'B'->2 ..... 'Z'->26 note that in the above notation, values are 1-based

here our Radix (R) == 26

the final value of a number X Y Z = X * R^2 + Y * R + Z

this looks similar to base-10 decimal number but the biggest difference is that the numbers on every digit starts with 1, instead of 0., and the max on each digit goes up to R (Radix) instead of R-1

for example Z== Radix then next number is AA = R + 1 = Z+1 ZZ = R * R + R next number is AAA = 1*R^2 + 1 * R + 1 = ZZ +1

so from the AAA notation to their sequence number (decimal) it's easy, but the other way is a bit tricky due to the way % and / operates
